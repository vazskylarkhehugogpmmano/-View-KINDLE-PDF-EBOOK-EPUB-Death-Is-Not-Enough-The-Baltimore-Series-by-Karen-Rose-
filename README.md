Title: IntricatePlot
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2021
Review: He can't believe it's happening again! Nineteen years ago, Thomas Thorne, now a well-known defense attorney, was accused and charged with murdering a fellow high school student. He was lucky ... there were people who absolutely refused to believe he was guilty and went to the wall for him. He was found not guilty and his life changed forever.This morning, his best friend and business partner, Gwen Weaver, discovers Thorne in bed with a dead woman and Thorne near dead himself. When Thorne comes to, he's in the hospital with no memory of who the woman was or how she wound up in his bed or how her blood was on his hands.Whoever is trying to frame Thorne is about to lead him down the rabbit hole of his past, something he thought he had outran long ago. How far will they go in their quest for vengeance? And who else will die?Karen Rose is my go-to author when i want a well-written Romantic Suspense with a nice blend of both romance and suspense. I want a mystery that I can lose myself in. This author's character development and story lines and intricate plots have never disappointed. Although 6th in the series, this is easily read as a stand-alone. Several characters from previous books are involved, but there are no spoilers to those.

Title: Extremelydisappointing
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2018
Review: So much for my hopes that Karen Rose was just going through a writing phase and would get back to better quality writing. The last book of the Cincinnati series had me thinking maybe.I liked the idea behind this plot and while it had no edge, it had moments which pushed me to give it 2 stars. If we had engaging characters regardless of the plot lacking mystery suspense, it would have added more stars. As it was it was a struggled to finish as I got no enjoyment from the way the characters on the good were written. Talked the talk on the backstories of Thorn which were interesting, mainly on who he defended but anyone can tell a story and make it sound good. Background noise (like we‚Äôve had before) as in the here and now any value I though his character had was ruined. You had a bit of silliness from few of them which was easily ignored but it was the pile of mush and making less of who Thorn and others were supposed to be by turning them into saps was the pits. There is nothing wrong with a touch of sentiment or the showing of emotions and if you have read enough of Karen Roses books, you‚Äôll know it was always there and worked as there was less. Its overload is non-effective and off putting. Each to their own.I had already put my misgivings in reviews of prior Karen Rose books of her writing. Why did I even bother? The first in the next new series sounds like the plot could be interesting but what good is it if you don‚Äôt have well written characters. Having read all 21 books where I enjoyed the majority of them, I‚Äôm not going to get that next one. I‚Äôve had enough of corny stuff smothering any worth in the characters.

Title: ThornesStorywasKiller
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2019
Review: I love a story where characters you love find a way to overcome past trauma. It gives you hope. Thorne had a horrible childhood and was blamed for a murder he didn't commit. He wasn't convicted but it changed his entire life. Now, an attorney himself, he's a force to be reckoned with. Then, his past comes around to haunt him and the people he loves begin to pay the price.Thorne is found in bed with a naked and dead woman from his past. Then things get really bad.Thorne has loved Gwen for years, but wasn't sure he wanted to chance his close friendship with her by admitting his feelings. Gwen has her own past to overcome and her own secrets.As things get worse Thorne finds he has friends willing to put themselves on the line to help him. He just doesn't want any of them to get hurt because of him.Thorne could be my new book boyfriend. I loved this character. The story has more suspense than mystery. It has some romance and some sexiness. It is a perfect blend of romantic suspense.

Review: I listened to the audiobook, and I was satisfied. I don‚Äôt remember getting the impression that Thorne was so emotional when he popped up in previous books, or that he was so into Gwyn, but apparently he had a tough-guy act that we got to see beneath in this one. I liked Gwyn, though I couldn‚Äôt relate to any of her experiences in life (thank god). I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs healing from her trauma, and I‚Äôm glad they realized they love each other. It was also nice to see the rest of the cast once again, that all my other faves are happy and healthy. Also, I realized that the Sacramento books won‚Äôt be completely new: Clay Maynard‚Äôs biological daughter‚Äôs step sister will be the heroine of the next book coming in February. That‚Äôs cool; I‚Äôm interested in getting to know her. And she‚Äôs my age, so perhaps I‚Äôll be able to relate to her better than I did Gwyn, who‚Äôs in her late thirties. Anyway, the plot in this book tied up some loose ends from previous books and wrapped Baltimore all up in a neat bow. I enjoyed this one as much as I enjoyed all the others‚Äîwhich is lots and lots!

Review: Someone has it out for Thorne, and for the second time in his life, he finds himself accused of a bloody murder he did not commit. Gwyn, the woman he‚Äôs patiently waited for for four and a half years is dragged in to the mess. As they fight to figure out just who is behind the vengeful plot, they both fight their demons and start to learn that just maybe they are better as a team.Karen Rose‚Äôs love of storytelling, intricate plot, and complex characters will have you sacrificing sleep to get to the end! I cannot wait for the next book!

Review: I have always looked forward to the novels written by Karen Rose, but her last two were different. . I didn't care for Thorn at all. Most of the book he was saying "I;m sorry" it about drove me nuts. The ending wasn't to bad , but the overall story was just ok. I;m hoping the next book she writes is more interesting.

Review: Every one of Karen Roses books have been enjoyed and this is no different love the way the characters link through and that these people can find peace beyond brutality. Always read as the mystery rather than the love story but enjoy each part equally
